The assignment will add a further condition to the Dialog Project that we applied together in the lab at the end of the day. Thus, the starting point will be from the last thing that we did in Dialog Project.

> Note: If you miss some piece of code through following the lab, you can find the last version of Dialog Project in this assignment.
